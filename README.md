# extbuilder

A macro tool that allows you to build C dependencies automatically

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  extbuilder:
    github: unn4m3d/extbuilder
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "extbuilder"

ExtBuilder.ext "../../ext/staticlib", static: true, output: "./staticlib"
lib StaticLib

end
```

Cmake is supported, as well as plain makefiles. There is also a thing called "Extfile" : a crystal program compiled with [this file](src/extbuilder/extb_ext.cr) as prelude.

See example in spec directory.
